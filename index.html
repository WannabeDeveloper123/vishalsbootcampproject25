          <p>
            In case you haven't noticed already, I'm Vishal Murali Kannan, and
            you're in my loft. Welcome! Argubaly the best Brawl Stars player on
            the planet (and yes, I know that's a sad metric for success), I've 
            been on the leaderboard twice. But, don't for a second think 
            that I don't touch grass. In fact, you could argue that I touch it
            too hard at times. I could not count the number of times I go for a
            dive in spikeball only to end up with my face dug into the ground,
            and the ball right where it was. However, I'll admit that Spikeball's a game of fun (Especially
            when I fake my opponent with convincing taps ,:)) Oh, and I've also
            played football (soccer for my American friends) for my school team.
            In fact, we had an undefeated season for the past two tourneys in
            HS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plus, did I forget to mention that I LOVE coding! No, really! I figured you
            would've known it looking at the effort I put into making my loft,
            but it's perfectly alright if you don't. :)

            Singapore, if you haven't known, is a tiny island country located on
            the peninsular tip of Malaysia. In fact, Singapore is so small that
            you'd have to look at the world map through a microscope to find
            where it's located. It's a country where you could get from one end
            to the other while watching a Coldplay concert (yikes!)... unless
            you end up behind a truck doing 40 on the passing lane. Putting my
            witty metaphors aside, I'll admit, it does get pretty hot out there.
            Anyway, here's a pic of the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, which
            I've taken about a thousand times considering Singapore's my home
            for the past 12 years. (I love elderly women screaming at me for
            taking a seat on the bus!)

            Anyways, feel free to get in touch with me if you wanna learn more
            about some places in Singapore left out by tour guides.
